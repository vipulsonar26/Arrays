Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000


Solution:

1. Iterate array from the begining
2. keep count of 1s in a variable. 
3. If we encounter 0 than we assign the previous variable count value to a another variable say count if previous variable value is greater than count.
